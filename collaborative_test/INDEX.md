Three seeds on the test split, scored from spike masks. Peer experiments from
`patch_v2_sw` use the `SW_` prefix and are reviewed under `peer_updates/`.

## Reference

| | fg_ari | fg_iou | obj_iou |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Slot Attention, ckpt-500, single published checkpoint | 0.6195 | 0.1241 | 0.0920 |

Not a 3-seed training mean, and trained on a different render; see
`baselines/slot_attention.md`.

## Where the goal stands

The goal is foreground IoU above 0.7. `PV2_0004` reaches **0.497**, up from the
baseline's 0.412, and is the first setting above baseline on all three metrics.

The 0.610 ceiling quoted earlier came from a ground-truth graph scored with the
old threshold and the old readout, and should be re-measured before it is used
again -- the same stale threshold made per-component spikes look useless until
they were scored at the right scale.

## Diagnostics kept out of the headline

Oracle results, per the contract. Never compared against Slot Attention.
